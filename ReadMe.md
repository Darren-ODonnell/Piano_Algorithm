This Program uses MidiSynth to produce piano notes.



This is an algorithm to pick a random chord and from this it chooses random notes to be played either in the melody portion or in the chord portion.



For the playNote and playChord methods, the first C note on the Midi Piano is at index 24 and from there on I have set a multiplier so that it picks a note and from the multiplier assigns the key used.
